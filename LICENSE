"Licensor" means any person or entity that distributes its Work.

"Software" means the original work of authorship made available under
this License.

"Work" means the Software and any additions to or derivative works of

thereof designed, made, sold, or provided by Nvidia or its affiliates.

The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and
"distribution" have the meaning as provided under U.S. copyright law;
provided, however, that for the purposes of this License, derivative
works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely
link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work.

Works, including the Software, are "made available" under this License
by including in or with the Work either (a) a copyright notice
referencing the applicability of this License to the Work, or (b) a
copy of this License.

2. License Grants

    2.1 Copyright Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
        License, each Licensor grants to you a perpetual, worldwide,
	    non-exclusive, royalty-free, copyright license to reproduce,
	        prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
		    sublicense and distribute its Work and any resulting derivative
		        works in any form.

	    copy of this License with your distribution, and (c) you retain
	        without modification any copyright, patent, trademark, or
		    attribution notices that are present in the Work.

    3.2 Derivative Works. You may specify that additional or different
        terms apply to the use, reproduction, and distribution of your
	    derivative works of the Work ("Your Terms") only if (a) Your Terms
	        provide that the use limitation in Section 3.3 applies to your
		    derivative works, and (b) you identify the specific derivative
		        works that are subject to Your Terms. Notwithstanding Your Terms,
			    this License (including the redistribution requirements in Section
			        3.1) will continue to apply to the Work itself.

    3.3 Use Limitation. The Work and any derivative works thereof only
        may be used or intended for use non-commercially. The Work or
	    derivative works thereof may be used or intended for use by Nvidia
	        or its affiliates commercially or non-commercially. As used herein,
		    "non-commercially" means for research or evaluation purposes only.

    3.4 Patent Claims. If you bring or threaten to bring a patent claim
        against any Licensor (including any claim, cross-claim or
	    counterclaim in a lawsuit) to enforce any patents that you allege
	        are infringed by any Work, then your rights under this License from
		    such Licensor (including the grants in Sections 2.1 and 2.2) will
		        terminate immediately.

    3.5 Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use any

KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR
NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF UNDERTAKING ANY ACTIVITIES UNDER
THIS LICENSE.

5. Limitation of Liability.

EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO LEGAL
THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE
SHALL ANY LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK
